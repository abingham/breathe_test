This is a test project for the `breathe` doxygen -> sphinx bridge.

Here's how to generate the docs (which is the main purpose of the project):

  % cd docs/doxygen
  % doxygen
  % cd ../sphinx/source
  % make clean
  % make html

Now just look at the output in <root>/docs/sphinx/source/_build/html/index.html.
